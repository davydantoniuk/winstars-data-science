# Winstars AI DS Internship Test

This repository contains two tasks focused on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP:
- `Task 1`: Implementing multiple classification models on the MNIST dataset using an object-oriented approach.
- `Task 2`: Building an ML pipeline that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) with image classification.

Each task is structured into separate folders with clear documentation, well-commented code, and Jupyter Notebook demonstrations.
